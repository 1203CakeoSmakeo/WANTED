<h1> Why it must be hunted down</h1>
 Turkey was first notice when a beam of light was striked down on the earth in kentucky on the date 12/03/3. when the turkey first came in contact with a human, it attacked it victim with it's beak and stared it victim in the eyes. But what really caused this turkey to be hunted down is because it can speak and can send telecenetic brain waves to other people and turkeys. Later on the specimen was spotted by a farmer and his kids and was tooken in there care. They expected a regular turkey but instead got one that caused brain trauma to the children and reached into the mind of the father and caused him to commit suicide. This turkey is the first known of it's kind and is said to be dangerous and possible of anything. The mayor of kentucky has said to not get into any type of situation that might agitate the turkey that might cause any type os problem.
